icu4c is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS provides libicucore.dylib (but nothing else).

If you need to have icu4c first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/sk/.bash_profile
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/sbin:$PATH"' >> /Users/sk/.bash_profile

For compilers to find icu4c you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/icu4c/include"

For pkg-config to find icu4c you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/pkgconfig"

Thanks for help, yes, I manually set the OPENSSL_SSL_LIBRARIES=/usr/local/ssl/lib OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/loca/ssl/include/openssl OPEN_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/ssl in CMakeCache.txt, it works!

Actually, there is no OPENSSL_LIBRARIES in CMakeCache.txt, it named OPENSSL_SSL_LIBRARIES.

https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/set.html
https://github.com/substack/libssh/issues/1


To find OpenSSL, run the following (edit the path accordingly): 

export OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/Cellar/openssl@1.1/1.1.1g/
export OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/Cellar/openssl@1.1/1.1.1g/include/

Steps:
+ edit CMakeLists.txt to add multiple files
+ print data to console
+ parse data -> json parser or read the stream
+ create class aeroplane
+ add id counter
+ cmake and header files: ensure correct file linking and build
+ abstract away http request in a separate class and file
+ define getters and setters in the aeroplane class 
+ API data can be null -> protect against it
+ write a template and a func used in Aeroplane::Update() to accept (_priv_var, planeData, Type)
+ test an instance of the aeroplane object
+ create aeroplane objects in a for loop based on parsed data using smart pointers
+ write data to an instance of the aeroplane object (smart pointer)
+ move an airoplane object to a std::vector<std::unique_ptr>
- refactor Controller.cpp
- create while loop fetching data from the API every 5 seconds, parse the data received, update aeroplane objects, create new and delete old ones
- message queue with request to each plane? ("https://opensky-network.org/api/states/all?time=1458564121&icao24=3c6444")

- Data:
  - Add (const &domain, const &geo) to Data() constructor
  - For loop for geo's members {builder.append_query}. Purpose: make constructor reusable for different API calls
  - Data::Fetch(): add a while loop
